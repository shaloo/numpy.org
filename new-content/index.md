NumPy - the fundamental package for scientific computing and data science with Python.

## NumPy in a nutshell

**Powerful N-dimensional arrays**
NumPy arrays are easy to use, versatile and fast. The NumPy vectorization, indexing and broadcasting concepts have become a standard way of thinking about array computing.

**Numerical computing tools**
Mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.

**Interoperable**
NumPy supports a wide range of computing platforms. If your data fits in memory and your code runs on a CPU, NumPy is for you! And if you need GPU, distributed or sparse arrays, NumPy works well with all the major libraries that provide that.

**Open source**
NumPy is free for everyone to use, publicly developed on GitHub by a diverse community, and distributed under a liberal BSD license.
